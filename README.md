# TheobromaCacao — TBCacao

## About

TBCacao is a small and simple Cocoa framework for dependency injection.

## Example Project
My other project [Qmind](https://github.com/qvacua/qmind) — a mind mapping app for OS X compatible with FreeMind — uses TBCacao quite extensively. Have a look for a real life example.
